                                <h2 class="h3">DISCLAIMER</h2>
                                <p>1. We have consulted with our legal counsel, and have been advised that the FanVerse Token or its related sale is not considered a security. The Company is separate from the Token and the FanVerse Network. The FanVerse Token is not a security since it is simply a form of payment accepted by the FanVerse Network—users have no rights attached to the Token, outside of the participation access provided by ownership of the token. If we determine that any service offering of the Company does fall within the scope of a law or regulation we may apply to have it regulated in our respective jurisdiction once the Token Sale has closed.</p>
                                <p>2. The Token is not an investment product. This document does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any security and shall not be construed in that way.</p>
                                <p>3. This document does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities, nor for the Tokens.</p>
                                <p>4. The Token Sale is not a sale of a company share of stock/derivative. It is a sale of a digital asset.</p>
                                <p>5. The purchase price of the Tokens is quoted in cryptocurrencies only and no determination of value in terms of fiat currency will be made.</p>
                                <p>6. The payment for the Tokens may be made by Users only in the cryptocurrencies mentioned on the Website and not in any fiat currency, in the manner specified in the Website and/or any of the Agreements.</p>
                                <p>7. The Tokens offer no rights to profits of the Company.</p>
                                <p>8. The Tokens are not designed or disingenuously devised to acquire stock or money, or any expectation of profits.</p>
                                <p>9. The Tokens may or may not be listed on various secondary markets for trading. However such trading is incidental and non-consequential to the primary purpose and service utility of FanVerse Tokens on the FanVerse Network.</p>
                                <p>10.

                                <p>11. Any usage of the term “currency” herein is a general term associated with an internal ledger system, built into the FanVerse software protocol; as it relates to the internal market value within the FanVerse network. The Company and its Affiliated Parties expressly disclaim any representation that the Company seeks to operate as an instrument of interstate commerce, “money”, or monetary instruments regulated by relevant governmental authorities inside or outside of the United States.</p>
                                <p>12. By purchasing Tokens from any country during the Token Sale and/or using them in connection with the FanVerse blockchain network, you will be bound by this document and all terms incorporated by reference.</p>
                                <p>13. This document or any of the Agreements will not be interpreted against one party merely as it was drafted by the party.</p>

The Company shall have the right to modify, at its sole discretion, any of the dates and times referred to in these Terms to account for such period of suspension.</p>

                                <p>3.1 The ETH or cryptographic token proceeds from Company’s sale of Tokens will be used: to compensate technical and non-technical staff, to cover the Company’s activities, marketing costs and operating expenses, and for other general working capital purposes.</p>
                                <h2 class="h3">Annexure C</h2>
                                <p> <strong>Certain Risks Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of Tokens</strong></p>
                                <p>Important Note: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the Tokens are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment contract or product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this Annexure C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Annexure C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information, or (iii) any action resulting from such information.</p>
                                <p class="underline">By purchasing, holding and using Tokens, You expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>
                                <p>1. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</p>
                                <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in Your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with Your digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service You use, may be able to misappropriate Your Tokens.</p>
                                <p>2. Risks Associated with Uniswap</p>
                                <p>The Uniswap protocol may be used for the purchase of Tokens during the Token Sale and/or the trading of Tokens.</p>
                                <p>Uniswap is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project built on Ethereum and serves as the largest decentralized exchange and automated market maker, which is a type of decentralized exchange protocol that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Uniswap is completely open-sourced. The open-source structure of the Uniswap protocol means that Uniswap may be susceptible to developments by users or contributors which could damage Uniswap and could affect the utilization of the FanVerse Network and the Tokens.</p>
                                <p>As an open source project, Uniswap will not be represented, maintained or monitored by an official organization or authority. Third parties may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the Uniswap protocol which may negatively impact Uniswap. Such events may result in a loss of trust in the security and operation of Uniswap and a decline in user activity and could negatively impact the market price of the Tokens.</p>
                                <p>Users may suffer impermanent loss when providing liquidity to Uniswap, deterring a portion of potential users.</p>
                                <p>3. Risk of Validator Attacks</p>
                                <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Blockchain protocol, the Tokens are susceptible to attacks by network validators in the course of validating Token transactions on the Blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the FanVerse Network and the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.</p>
                                <p>4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</p>
                                <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the FanVerse Network or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. </p>
                                <p>5.Risks Associated With Markets for Tokens</p>
                                <p>The Tokens are intended to be used within the FanVerse Network, and Company may not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt of services on the FanVerse platform, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to the Tokens You hold. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges (like Uniswap), such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>
                                <p>A decrease in the price of a single blockchain assets may cause volatility in the entire blockchain asset industry and may affect other blockchain assets including the Tokens. For example, a security breach that affects user confidence in BTC or ETH may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of the Tokens and other blockchain assets to fluctuate.</p>
                                <p>6. Risk of Uninsured Losses</p>
                                <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless You specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss of Tokens or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by Us, to offer recourse to You.</p>
                                <p>7. Risks Associated With Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</p>
                                <p>The regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the FanVerse Network and the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the FanVerse Network and the Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the FanVerse Network and the Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that requires registration or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
                                <p>8. Risks Arising From Taxation</p>
                                <p>The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek Your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to You, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>
                                <p>9. Risks Associated With the Development and Maintenance of the Network</p>
                                <p>The FanVerse Token is a newly formed token and the FanVerse Network is a newly formed network and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Tokens and FanVerse Network to follow the specifications set forth in Annexure A, and we intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward promoting the benefits of the FanVerse Network, the community of network validators may make changes to the specifications of the Tokens or FanVerse Network for any number of reasons. </p>
                                <p>This could create the risk that the Tokens or FanVerse Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet Your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to promote the benefits of the FanVerse Network, it is still possible that the FanVerse Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the FanVerse Network and Tokens.</p>
                                <p>10. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of ETH, BTC, and Other Currency Value</p>
                                <p>The FanVerse Team intends to use certain proceeds from selling Tokens to fund marketing expenses, its activities, support research and development and the maintenance of the FanVerse Network, and other general working capital purposes, as described further in Annexure B. The proceeds of the Token sale will be denominated in ETH, and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. In addition, some sales of the Tokens may also be denominated in fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Token Sale period, the Company team may not be able to fund said activities, or may not be able to support research and development or maintenance of the FanVerse Network in the manner that it intended.</p>
                                <p>11. Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network</p>
                                <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of ETH (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, lack of use of the FanVerse Network, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the FanVerse Network may no longer operate and/or the Company may dissolve.</p>
                                <p>12. Risks Involving Cloud Computing and Storage</p>
                                <p>Network validators may be operated by third parties. Since operators of network validators (including those operated by the Company may use third-party cloud computing and storage providers, the FanVerse Network is susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud, which may be compromised in the event of a cyber-attack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the FanVerse Network may be interrupted and become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the FanVerse Network, there is the risk that the FanVerse Network may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices with the FanVerse Network. The risk that the FanVerse Network may face interruptions and security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the FanVerse Network and therefore the future utility of any Tokens that You hold.</p>
                                <p>13. Risks Arising From No Network Control</p>
                                <p>The FanVerse Network is comprised of open-source technologies that depend on a network of computers to run certain software programs to process transactions. Because of this less centralized model, the Company has limited control over the FanVerse Network. In addition, the Buyers are not and will not be entitled, to vote or receive dividends, nor will anything be construed to confer on the Buyers any right to vote for the election of directors of the Company, or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive equity rights or otherwise.</p>
                                <p>14. Unanticipated Risks</p>
                                <p>Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Annexure C, there are other risks associated with Your purchase, holding and use of Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Annexure C.</p>

                                <p class="ml-1">(b) <strong>Severability</strong>: If any term, clause, or provision of these T&C is held unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these T&C and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these T&C.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(c) <strong>No Waiver</strong>: The failure of the Website Owner to require or enforce strict performance by the Buyer of any provision of these Agreements or failure to exercise any right under these Agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Company’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by the Company of any provision, condition, or requirement of these T&C shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these T&C, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by the Company shall be deemed a modification of these T&C nor be legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, and executed by the User and a duly appointed officer, employee, or agent of the Company.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(d) <strong>Force Majeure</strong>: The Company is not liable for failure to perform solely caused by unavoidable casualty, delays in delivery of materials, embargoes, government orders, acts of civil or military authorities, acts by common carriers, emergency conditions (including weather conditions) incompatible with safety or good quality workmanship, or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the Party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect to suspend the Agreements, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The Party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured Party in all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured Party.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(e) <strong>Cooperation with Legal Authorities</strong>: The Company and FanVerse Team will cooperate with all law enforcement enquiries, subpoenas, or requests provided they are fully supported and documented by the law in the relevant jurisdictions.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(f) <strong>State Policies</strong>: The Website Owner and its Affiliated Parties strictly follow anti-money laundering (“ <strong>AML</strong>”), “know your customer” (“ <strong>KYC</strong>”) and other banking or government regulations in respective jurisdictions. Each and any User fully agrees to assist the Website Owner in complying with all of the mentioned regulations and provide any necessary information if such is required from the User by the competent authority. For greater clarity, all purchases of the Tokens during the Token Sale shall be subject to the completion of the KYC Checks to the satisfaction of the Company. In relation to the KYC Checks, each Purchaser hereby agrees:</p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(i) to promptly comply and cooperate with all requests for information (for example, the Purchaser’s identity, place of residence, and source of funds) by the Company for the purposes of the KYC Checks;</p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(ii) to ensure that all information provided to the Company in connection with the Purchaser’s participation in the Token Sale is accurate and not misleading, and to promptly notify the Company of any change to the information supplied by the Company;</p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(iii) that the Company may (i) disclose any information relating to, or provided by, the Purchaser to the Company to the service providers performing the KYC Checks on behalf of the Company, the developer of the FanVerse Network, any governmental or regulatory authority, or to any other person as may be required by any applicable laws, and (ii) report any suspicious transaction, as determined in its sole discretion, to any relevant governmental or regulatory authority; and</p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(iv) any personal data submitted by the Purchaser for the purposes of the KYC Check shall be subject to the terms of the privacy policy contained in the Website. </p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(v) A Purchaser shall not be eligible to participate in the Token Sale and must not purchase the Tokens if the Purchaser is:</p>
                                <p class="ml-3">a. (<i>if the Purchaser is a natural person</i>) below 18 years of age or such higher age of majority prescribed by the applicable laws;</p>
                                <p class="ml-3">b. a citizen, resident (tax or otherwise) or a person located or domiciled in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, People’s Republic of China, the United States of America, Canada, Singapore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Libya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Yemen, Syria; or</p>
                                <p class="ml-3">c. a citizen, resident, tax or otherwise, or a person located or domiciled in any geographic area or country in which its participation in the Token Sale may be prohibited or restricted by the applicable laws, including, without limitation, any laws relating to anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism).</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(g) <strong>Updates</strong>: The Agreements may be updated with or without notice from time to time and the version available at the Website on a given date will be considered as the governing document for any incidents arising on that date. An update of the Agreements on the Website will be considered as valid notice to everyone and all users and interested parties are requested to visit the Website regularly to update themselves about the latest updates to the Agreements.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(h) The Agreements will not be interpreted against one Party merely as it was drafted by the Party.</p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(i) <strong>Construction</strong>: For purposes of the Agreements, whenever the context requires:</p>
                                <p class="ml-2">(i) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa;</p>

                                <p class="ml-2">(iii) the words include and including, and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words without limitation. </p>
                                <p class="ml-1">(j) <strong>Assignment</strong>: The User shall not assign any of the Agreements, either in whole or in part, without the express prior written consent of the Website Owner. Any such attempted assignment shall be void.</p>
